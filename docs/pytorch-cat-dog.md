<sup>Transfer Learning - Classification</sup></s></p>

# Re-training on the Cat/Dog Dataset

The first model that we'll be re-training is a simple model that recognizes two classes:  cat or dog.

<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/python/docs/images/pytorch-cat-dog.jpg" width="700">

Provided below is an 800MB dataset that includes 5000 training images, 1000 validation images, and 200 test images, each evenly split between the cat and dog classes.  The set of training images is used for transfer learning, while the validation set is used to evaluate classification accuracy during training, and the test images are to be used by us after training completes.  The network is never directly trained on the validation and test sets, only the training set.

The images from the dataset are made up of many different breeds of dogs and cats, including large felines like tigers and mountain lions since the amount of cat images available was a bit lower than dogs.  Some of the images also picture humans, which the detector is essentially trained to ignore as background and focus on the cat vs. dog content.

To get started, first make sure that you have [PyTorch installed](pytorch-transfer-learning.md#installing-pytorch) on your Jetson, then download the dataset below and kick off the training script.  After that, we'll test the re-trained model in TensorRT on some static images and a live camera feed. 

## Downloading the Data

During this tutorial, we'll store the datasets under a common location, like `~/datasets`.  You can store them wherever you want, just substitute your desired path for `~/datasets` during the steps below:

``` bash
$ mkdir ~/datasets
$ cd ~/datasets
```

Next, download and extract the data:

``` bash
$ wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/o577zd8yp3lmxf5zhm38svrbrv45am3y.gz -O cat_dog.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf cat_dog.tar.gz
```

Mirrors of the dataset are available here:

* <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16E3yFvVS2DouwgIl4TPFJvMlhGpnYWKF/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/16E3yFvVS2DouwgIl4TPFJvMlhGpnYWKF/view?usp=sharing</a>

## Re-training ResNet-18 Model

The PyTorch training scripts are located in the repo under <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/tree/master/python/training/classification">`jetson-inference/python/training/classification/`</a>.  These scripts aren't specific to any one dataset, so we'll use the same PyTorch code with each of the example datasets from this tutorial.  By default it's set to train a ResNet-18 model, but you can change that with the `--arch` flag.

To launch the training, run the following commands:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/python/training/classification
$ python train.py --model-dir=cat_dog ~/datasets/cat_dog
```

As training begins, you should see text appear from the console like the following:

``` bash
Use GPU: 0 for training

```

To stop training at any time, you can press `Ctrl+C`.  You can also restart the training again later using the `--resume` and `--epoch-start` flags, so you don't need to wait for training to complete before testing out the model.  

Run `python train.py --help` for more information about each option that's available for you to use, including other networks that you can try with the `--arch` flag.

### Training Metrics

The statistics output above during the training process correspond to the following info:

* Epoch:  an epoch is one complete training pass over the dataset
	* `Epoch: [N]` means you are currently on epoch 0, 1, 2, ect.
	* The default is to run for 35 epochs (you can change this with the `--epochs=N` flag)
* `[N/625]` is the current image batch from the epoch that you are on
	* Training images are processed in mini-batches to improve performance
	* The default batch size is 8 images, which can be set with the `--batch=N` flag
	* Multiply the numbers in brackets by the batch size (e.g. batch `[100/625]` -> image `[800/5000]`)
* Time:  processing time of the current image batch (in seconds)
* Data:  disk loading time of the current image batch (in seconds)
* Loss:  the accumulated errors that the model made (expected vs. predicted)
* `Acc@1`:  the Top-1 classification accuracy over the batch
	* Top-1, meaning that the model predicted exactly the correct class
* `Acc@5`:  the Top-5 classification accuracy over the batch
	* Top-5, meaning that the correct class was one of the Top 5 outputs the model predicted
	* Since this Cat/Dog example only has 2 classes (Cat and Dog), Top-5 is always 100%
	* Other datasets from the tutorial have more than 5 classes, where Top-5 is valid 

You can keep an eye on these statistics during training to gauge how well the model is trained, and if you want to keep going or stop and test.  As mentioned above, you can restart training again later if you desire.

### Model Accuracy

On this dataset of 5000 images, training ResNet-18 takes approximately ~7-8 minutes per epoch on Jetson Nano, or around 4 hours to train the model to 35 epochs and 80% classification accuracy.  Below is a graph for analyzing the training progression of epochs versus model accuracy:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/python/docs/images/pytorch-cat-dog-training.jpg" width="700"></p>

At around epoch 30, the ResNet-18 model reaches 80% accuracy, and at epoch 65 it converges on 82.5% accuracy.  With additional training time, you could further improve the accuracy by increasing the size of the dataset (see the [Generating More Data](#generating-more-data-optional) section below) or by trying more complex models.

By default the training script is set to run for 35 epochs, but if you don't wish to wait that long to test out your model, you can exit training early and proceed to the next step (optionally re-starting the training again later from where you left off).  You can also download this completed model that was trained for a full 100 epochs from here:

* <a href="https://nvidia.box.com/s/zlvb4y43djygotpjn6azjhwu0r3j0yxc">https://nvidia.box.com/s/zlvb4y43djygotpjn6azjhwu0r3j0yxc</a>

Note that the models are saved under `jetson-inference/python/training/classification/cat_dog/`, including a checkpoint from the latest epoch and the best-performing model that has the highest classification accuracy.  You can change the directory that the models are saved to by altering the `--model-dir` flag.

## Converting the Model to ONNX

To run our re-trained ResNet-18 model with TensorRT for testing and realtime inference, first we need to convert the PyTorch model into <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX format</a> format so that TensorRT can load it.  ONNX is an open model format that supports many of the popular ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, TensorRT, and others, so it simplifies transferring models between tools.

PyTorch comes with built-in support for exporting PyTorch models to ONNX, so run the following command to convert our Cat/Dog model with the provided `onnx_export.py` script:

``` bash
python onnx_export.py --model-dir=cat_dog
```

This will create a model called `resnet18.onnx` under `jetson-inference/python/training/classification/cat_dog/`

## Processing Images with TensorRT

To classify some static test images, we'll use the extended command-line parameters to `imagenet` to load our customized ResNet-18 model that we re-trained above.  To run these commands, the working directory of your terminal should still be located in:  `jetson-inference/python/training/classification/`

```bash
DATASET=~/datasets/cat_dog

# C++
imagenet --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt $DATASET/test/cat/01.jpg cat.jpg

# Python
imagenet.py --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt $DATASET/test/cat/01.jpg cat.jpg
```

<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/python/docs/images/pytorch-cat.jpg">

```bash
# C++
imagenet --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt $DATASET/test/dog/01.jpg dog.jpg

# Python
imagenet.py --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt $DATASET/test/dog/01.jpg dog.jpg
```

<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/python/docs/images/pytorch-dog.jpg">

### Processing all the Test Images

There are 200 test images included with the dataset between the cat and dog classes, or you can download your own pictures to try.  You can process them all like this:

``` bash
mkdir $DATASET/test_output_cat $DATASET/test_output_dog

imagenet --model=$NET/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/../labels.txt \
           $DATASET/test/cat $DATASET/test_output_cat

imagenet --model=$NET/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/../labels.txt \
           $DATASET/test/dog $DATASET/test_output_dog
```

In this instance, all the images will be read from the dataset's `test/` directory, and saved to the `test_output/` directory.  

For more info about loading/saving sequences of images, see the [Camera Streaming and Multimedia](aux-streaming.md#sequences) page.

Next, we'll try running our re-trained model on a live camera feed.

## Running the Live Camera Program

If you have a furry friend at home, you can run the camera program and see how it works!  Like the previous step, `imagenet` supports extended command-line parameters for loading customized models:

```bash
DATASET=~/datasets/cat_dog

# C++ (MIPI CSI)
imagenet --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt csi://0

# Python (MIPI CSI)
imagenet.py --model=cat_dog/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt csi://0
```
> **note:** for information about supported video streams and protocols, please see the [Camera Streaming and Multimedia](aux-streaming.md) page.

## Generating More Data (Optional)

The images from the Cat/Dog dataset were randomly pulled from a larger 22.5GB <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LsxHT9HX5gM2wMVqPUfILgrqVlGtqX1o">subset of ILSCRV12</a> by using the [`cat-dog-dataset.sh`](../tools/cat-dog-dataset.sh) script.  This first Cat/Dog dataset is intentionally kept smaller to keep the training time down, but by using this script you can re-generate it with additional images to create a more robust model.  

Larger datasets take more time to train, so you can proceed to the [next example](pytorch-plants.md) awhile, but if you were to want to expand the Cat/Dog dataset, first download the source data from here:

* <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LsxHT9HX5gM2wMVqPUfILgrqVlGtqX1o">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LsxHT9HX5gM2wMVqPUfILgrqVlGtqX1o</a>

After extracting this archive, edit [`tools/cat-dog-dataset.sh`](../tools/cat-dog-dataset.sh) with the following modifications:

* Substitue the location of the extracted `ilsvrc12_subset` in the `IMAGENET_DIR` variable
* Then create an empty folder somewhere for cat_dog, and substitue that location in `OUTPUT_DIR`
* Change the size of the dataset by modifying `NUM_TRAIN`, `NUM_VAL`, and `NUM_TEST` variables

The script creates subdirectories for train, val, and test underneath the `OUTPUT_DIR`, and will then fill those directories with the specified number of images for each.  Then you can [train the model](#re-training-resnet-18-model) the same way as above, optionally using the `--resume` and `--epoch-start` flags to pick up training where you left off (if you don't want to restart training from the beginning).  Remember to re-export the model to ONNX after re-training. 

In the following example, we'll train another model on a datset of plants and trees that supports 20 object classes.
