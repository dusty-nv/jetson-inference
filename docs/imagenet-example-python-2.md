<sup>Image Recognition</sup></p>  

# Coding Your Own Image Recognition Program (Python)
In the previous step, we ran a sample application that came with the `jetson-inference` repo.  

Now, we're going to walk through creating a new program from scratch in Python for image recognition called [`my-recognition.py`](../python/examples/my-recognition.py).  This script will load an arbitrary image from disk and classify it using the [`imageNet`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.inference.html#imageNet) object.  The completed source at [`python/examples/my-recognition.py`](../python/examples/my-recognition.py)

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import jetson.inference
import jetson.utils

import argparse

# parse the command line
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("filename", type=str, help="filename of the image to process")
parser.add_argument("--network", type=str, default="googlenet", help="model to use, can be:  googlenet, resnet-18, ect.")
opt = parser.parse_args()

# load an image (into shared CPU/GPU memory)
img = jetson.utils.loadImage(opt.filename)

# load the recognition network
net = jetson.inference.imageNet(opt.network)

# classify the image
class_idx, confidence = net.Classify(img)

# find the object description
class_desc = net.GetClassDesc(class_idx)

# print out the result
print("image is recognized as '{:s}' (class #{:d}) with {:f}% confidence".format(class_desc, class_idx, confidence * 100))
```

## Setting up the Project

You can store the `my-recognition.py` example that we will be creating wherever you want on your Jetson.  For simplicity, this guide will create it along with some test images inside a directory under the user's home directory located at `~/my-recognition-python`.

Run these commands from a terminal to create the directory and files required:  

``` bash
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir my-recognition-python
$ cd my-recognition-python
$ touch my-recognition.py
$ chmod +x my-recognition.py
$ wget https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/black_bear.jpg 
$ wget https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/brown_bear.jpg
$ wget https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/polar_bear.jpg 
```

Some test images are also downloaded to the folder with the `wget` commands above.  

Next, we'll add the Python code for the program to the empty source file we created here.

## Source Code

Open up `my-recognition.py` in your editor of choice (or run `gedit my-recognition.py`).  

First, let's add a shebang sequence to the very top of the file to automatically use the Python interpreter:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

Next, we'll import the Python modules that we're going to use in the script.

#### Importing Modules

Add `import` statements to load the [`jetson.inference`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.inference.html) and [`jetson.utils`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.utils.html) modules used for recognizing images and image loading.  We'll also load the standard `argparse` package for parsing the command line.

``` python
import jetson.inference
import jetson.utils

import argparse
```

> **note**:  these Jetson modules are installed during the `sudo make install` step of [building the repo](building-repo-2.md#compiling-the-project).  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you did not run `sudo make install`, then these packages won't be found when we go to run the example.  


#### Parsing the Command Line

Next, add some boilerplate code to parse the image filename and an optional `--network` parameter:

``` python
# parse the command line
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("filename", type=str, help="filename of the image to process")
parser.add_argument("--network", type=str, default="googlenet", help="model to use, can be:  googlenet, resnet-18, ect. (see --help for others)")
opt = parser.parse_args()
```

This example loads and classifies an image that the user specifies.  It will be expected to be run like this:

``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py my_image.jpg
```

The desired image filename to be loaded should be substituted for `my_image.jpg`.  You can also optionally specify the `--network` parameter to change the classification network that's used (the default is GoogleNet):

``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py --network=resnet-18 my_image.jpg
```

See the [Downloading Other Classification Models](imagenet-console-2.md#downloading-other-classification-models) section from the previous page for more information about downloading other networks.


#### Loading the Image from Disk

You can load images from disk into shared CPU/GPU memory using the `loadImage()` function. Supported formats are JPG, PNG, TGA, and BMP.

Add this line to load the image with the filename that was specified from the command line:

``` python
img = jetson.utils.loadImage(opt.filename)
```

The returned image will be a [`jetson.utils.cudaImage`](aux-image.md#image-capsules-in-python) object that contains attributes like width, height, and pixel format:

```python
<jetson.utils.cudaImage>
  .ptr      # memory address (not typically used)
  .size     # size in bytes
  .shape    # (height,width,channels) tuple
  .width    # width in pixels
  .height   # height in pixels
  .channels # number of color channels
  .format   # format string
  .mapped   # true if ZeroCopy
```

For more information about accessing images from Python, see the [Image Manipulation with CUDA](aux-image.md) page.  For simplicity, we just load a single image here. To load a video or sequence of images, you would want to use the [`videoSource`](aux-streaming.md#source-code) API like the previous [`imagenet.py`](../python/examples/imagenet.py) sample does.

#### Loading the Image Recognition Network

Using the [`imageNet`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.inference.html#imageNet) object, the following code will load the desired classification model with TensorRT.  Unless you specified a different network using the `--network` flag, by default it will load GoogleNet, which was already downloaded when you initially [built the `jetson-inference` repo](building-repo-2.md#downloading-models) (the `ResNet-18` model was also selected by default to be downloaded).

All of the available classification models are pre-trained on the ImageNet ILSVRC dataset, which can recognize up to [1000 different classes](../data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt) of objects, like different kinds of fruits and vegetables, many different species of animals, along with everyday man-made objects like vehicles, office furniture, sporting equipment, ect.   

``` python
# load the recognition network
net = jetson.inference.imageNet(opt.network)
```

#### Classifying the Image

Next, we are going to classify the image with the recognition network using the `imageNet.Classify()` function:  

``` python
# classify the image
class_idx, confidence = net.Classify(img)
```

`imageNet.Classify()` accepts the image and it's dimensions, and performs the inferencing with TensorRT.  

It returns a tuple containing the integer index of the object class that the image was recognized as, along with the floating-point confidence value of the result.

#### Interpreting the Results

As the final step, let's retrieve the class description and print out the results of the classification:

``` python
# find the object description
class_desc = net.GetClassDesc(class_idx)

# print out the result
print("image is recognized as '{:s}' (class #{:d}) with {:f}% confidence".format(class_desc, class_idx, confidence * 100))
```

`imageNet.Classify()` returns the index of the recognized object class (between `0` and `999` for these models that were trained on ILSVRC).  Given the class index, the `imageNet.GetClassDesc()` function will then return the string containing the text description of that class.  These descriptions are automatically loaded from [`ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt`](../data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt).

That's it!  That is all the Python code we need for image classification.  See the [completed source](#coding-your-own-image-recognition-program-python) above.

## Running the Example

Now that our Python program is complete, let's classify the test images that we [downloaded](#setting-up-the-project) at the beginning of this page:  

``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py polar_bear.jpg
image is recognized as 'ice bear, polar bear, Ursus Maritimus, Thalarctos maritimus' (class #296) with 99.999878% confidence
```
<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/polar_bear.jpg" width="400">

``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py brown_bear.jpg
image is recognized as 'brown bear, bruin, Ursus arctos' (class #294) with 99.928925% confidence
```
<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/brown_bear.jpg" width="400">


``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py black_bear.jpg
image is recognized as 'American black bear, black bear, Ursus americanus, Euarctos americanus' (class #295) with 98.898628% confidence
```
<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/master/data/images/black_bear.jpg" width="400">

You can also choose to use a [different network](imagenet-console-2.md#downloading-other-classification-models) by specifying the `--network` flag, like so:

``` bash
$ ./my-recognition.py --network=resnet-18 polar_bear.jpg
image is recognized as 'ice bear, polar bear, Ursus Maritimus, Thalarctos maritimus' (class #296) with 99.743396% confidence
```

Next, we'll walk through the creation of the C++ version of this program.
