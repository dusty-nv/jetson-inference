<sup>System Setup</sup></p>   

# Building the Project from Source

Provided with the repo is a library of TensorRT-accelerated deep learning networks for image recognition, object detection with localization (i.e. bounding boxes), and semantic segmentation.  This inferencing library (`libjetson-inference`) is intended to be built & run on the Jetson, and includes support for both C++ and Python.  

Various pre-trained DNN models are automatically downloaded to get you up and running quickly.  It's also setup to accept customized models that you may have trained yourself, including support for Caffe, TensorFlow UFF, and ONNX.

The latest source can be obtained from [GitHub](http://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) and compiled onboard Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, and Jetson AGX Xavier once they have been [flashed with JetPack](jetpack-setup-2.md) or setup with the pre-populated [SD card image](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write) for Jetson Nano.

### Quick Reference

Here's a condensed form of the commands to download, build, and install the project:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake libpython3-dev python3-numpy
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
$ cd jetson-inference
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```
Below we will go through each step and discuss various build options along the way.
 
### Cloning the Repo

To download the code, navigate to a folder of your choosing on the Jetson.  First, make sure git and cmake are installed:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake
```

Then clone the `jetson-inference` project:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
$ cd jetson-inference
$ git submodule update --init
```

Remember to run the `git submodule update --init` step (or clone with the `--recursive` flag).

### Python Development Packages

The Python functionality of this project is implemented through Python extension modules that provide bindings to the native C++ code using the Python C API.  While configuring the project, the repo searches for versions of Python that have development packages installed on the system, and will then build the bindings for each version of Python that's present (e.g. Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7).  It will also build numpy bindings for versions of numpy that are installed.

By default, Ubuntu comes with the `libpython-dev` and `python-numpy` packages pre-installed (which are for Python 2.7).  Although the Python 3.6 interpreter is pre-installed by Ubuntu, the Python 3.6 development packages (`libpython3-dev`) and `python3-numpy` are not.  These development packages are required for the bindings to build using the Python C API.  

So if you want the project to create bindings for Python 3.6, install these packages before proceeding:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev python3-numpy
``` 

Installing these additional packages will enable the repo to build the extension bindings for Python 3.6, in addition to Python 2.7 (which is already pre-installed).  Then after the build process, the [`jetson.inference`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.inference.html) and [`jetson.utils`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.utils.html) packages will be available to use within your Python environments.


### Configuring with CMake

Next, create a build directory within the project and run `cmake` to configure the build.  When `cmake` is run, a script is launched ([`CMakePreBuild.sh`](../CMakePreBuild.sh)) that will install any required dependencies and download DNN models for you.

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference    # omit if working directory is already jetson-inference/ from above
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
```

> **note**: this command will launch the [`CMakePreBuild.sh`](../CMakePreBuild.sh) script which asks for sudo privileges while installing some prerequisite packages on the Jetson. The script also downloads pre-trained networks from web services.


### Downloading Models

The project comes with many pre-trained networks that can you can choose to have downloaded and installed through the **Model Downloader** tool ([`download-models.sh`](../tools/download-models.sh)).  By default, not all of the models are initially selected for download to save disk space.  You can select the models you want, or run the tool again later to download more models another time.

When initially configuring the project, `cmake` will automatically run the downloader tool for you:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/images/download-models.jpg" width="650">

> **note**: for users that are unable to connect to Box.com to download the models, a mirror is provided here:<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/releases`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/releases)

To run the Model Downloader tool again later, you can use the following commands:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/tools
$ ./download-models.sh
```

### Installing PyTorch

If you are using JetPack 4.2 or newer, another tool will now run that can optionally install PyTorch on your Jetson if you want to re-train networks with [transfer learning](pytorch-transfer-learning.md) later in the tutorial.  This step is optional, and if you don't wish to do the transfer learning steps, you don't need to install PyTorch and can skip this step.

If desired, select the PyTorch package versions for Python 2.7 and/or Python 3.6 that you want installed and hit `Enter` to continue.  Otherwise, leave the options un-selected, and it will skip the installation of PyTorch. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/images/pytorch-installer.jpg" width="650">

> **note**: the automated PyTorch installation tool requires JetPack 4.2 (or newer)<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for other versions, see [`http://eLinux.org/Jetson_Zoo`](https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#PyTorch_.28Caffe2.29) to build from source.

You can also run this tool again later if you decide that you want to install PyTorch at another time:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/build
$ ./install-pytorch.sh
```

Running these commands will prompt you with the same dialog as seen above.

### Compiling the Project

Make sure you are still in the `jetson-inference/build` directory, created above in step #3.

Then run `make` followed by `sudo make install` to build the libraries, Python extension bindings, and code samples:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/build          # omit if working directory is already build/ from above
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

The project will be built to `jetson-inference/build/aarch64`, with the following directory structure:

```
|-build
   \aarch64
      \bin             where the sample binaries are built to
         \networks     where the network models are stored
         \images       where the test images are stored
      \include         where the headers reside
      \lib             where the libraries are build to
```

In the build tree, you can find the binaries residing in `build/aarch64/bin/`, headers in `build/aarch64/include/`, and libraries in `build/aarch64/lib/`.  These also get installed under `/usr/local/` during the `sudo make install` step.

The Python bindings for the [`jetson.inference`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.inference.html) and [`jetson.utils`](https://rawgit.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/html/python/jetson.utils.html) modules also get installed during the `sudo make install` step under `/usr/lib/python*/dist-packages/`.  If you update the code, remember to run it again.
 

### Digging Into the Code

See the **[API Reference](../README.md#api-reference)** documentation for the vision primitives available in `libjetson-inference`, including `imageNet` for image recognition, `detectNet` for object localization, and `segNet` for semantic segmentation.  Familiarize yourself with the C++ or Python versions of these objects, depending on which language you prefer to use.

#### C++

Below is a partial listing of the [`imageNet`](../c/imageNet.h) C++ class that we'll use in upcoming steps of the tutorial:

```

All of the DNN objects in the repo inherit from the shared [`tensorNet`](../c/tensorNet.h) object, which contains the common TensorRT code.
