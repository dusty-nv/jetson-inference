# Classifying Images with ImageNet
There are multiple types of deep learning networks available, including recognition, detection/localization, and semantic segmentation.  The first deep learning capability we're highlighting in this tutorial is **image recognition**, using classifcation networks that have been trained on large datasets to identify scenes and objects.

<img src="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/raw/pytorch/docs/images/imagenet.jpg" width="900">

The [`imageNet`](../c/imageNet.h) object accepts an input image and outputs the probability for each class.  Having been trained on the ImageNet ILSVRC dataset of **[1000 objects](../data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt)**, the GoogleNet and ResNet-18 models were automatically downloaded during the build step.  See [below](#downloading-other-classification-models) for other classification models that can be downloaded and used as well.

As an example of using the [`imageNet`](../c/imageNet.h) class, we provide sample programs for C++ and Python:

- [`imagenet.cpp`](../examples/imagenet/imagenet.cpp) (C++) 
- [`imagenet.py`](../python/examples/imagenet.py) (Python) 

These samples are able to classify images, videos, and camera feeds.  For more info about the various types of input/output streams supported, see the [Camera Streaming and Multimedia](aux-streaming.md) page.


### Using the ImageNet Program on Jetson

First, let's try using the `imagenet` program to test imageNet recognition on some example images.  It loads an image (or images), uses TensorRT and the `imageNet` class to perform the inference, then overlays the classification result and saves the output image.  The project comes with sample images for you to use located under the `images/` directory.

After [building](building-repo-2.md) the project, make sure your terminal is located in the `aarch64/bin` directory:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin
```

Next, let's classify an example image with the `imagenet` program, using either the [C++](../examples/imagenet/imagenet.cpp) or [Python](../python/examples/imagenet.py) variants:

``` bash
# C++
$ ./imagenet-console --network=googlenet images/orange_0.jpg output_0.jpg     # --network flag is optional (default is googlenet)

# Python
$ ./imagenet-console.py --network=googlenet images/orange_0.jpg output_0.jpg  # --network flag is optional (default is googlenet)
```

> **note**:  the first time you run each model, TensorRT will take a few minutes to optimize the network. <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this optimized network file is then cached to disk, so future runs using the model will load faster.

``` bash
# C++
$ ./imagenet images/strawberry_0.jpg output_1.jpg

# Python
$ ./imagenet.py images/strawberry_0.jpg output_1.jpg
```

In addition to loading single images, you can also load a directory or sequence of images, or a video file.  For more info, see the [Camera Streaming and Multimedia](aux-streaming.md) page or launch the application with the `--help` flag.

### Downloading Other Classification Models

By default, the project will download the GoogleNet and ResNet-18 networks during the build step.

There are other pre-trained models that you can use as well, should you choose to [download](building-repo-2.md#downloading-models) them:

| Network       | CLI argument   | NetworkType enum |
| --------------|----------------|------------------|
| AlexNet       | `alexnet`      | `ALEXNET`        |
| GoogleNet     | `googlenet`    | `GOOGLENET`      |
| GoogleNet-12  | `googlenet-12` | `GOOGLENET_12`   |
| ResNet-18     | `resnet-18`    | `RESNET_18`      |
| ResNet-50     | `resnet-50`    | `RESNET_50`      |
| ResNet-101    | `resnet-101`   | `RESNET_101`     |
| ResNet-152    | `resnet-152`   | `RESNET_152`     |
| VGG-16        | `vgg-16`       | `VGG-16`         |
| VGG-19        | `vgg-19`       | `VGG-19`         |
| Inception-v4  | `inception-v4` | `INCEPTION_V4`   |

> **note**:  to download additional networks, run the [Model Downloader](building-repo-2.md#downloading-models) tool<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ cd jetson-inference/tools` <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ ./download-models.sh` <br/>

Generally the more complex networks can have greater classification accuracy, with increased runtime.

### Using Different Classification Models

You can specify which model to load by setting the `--network` flag on the command line to one of the corresponding CLI arguments from the table above.  By default, GoogleNet is loaded if the optional `--network` flag isn't specified.

Below are some examples of using the ResNet-18 model:

``` bash
# C++
$ ./imagenet --network=resnet-18 images/jellyfish.jpg output_jellyfish.jpg

# Python
$ ./imagenet.py --network=resnet-18 images/jellyfish.jpg output_jellyfish.jpg
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/images/imagenet_jellyfish.jpg" width="650">

``` bash
# C++
$ ./imagenet --network=resnet-18 images/stingray.jpg output_stingray.jpg

# Python
$ ./imagenet.py --network=resnet-18 images/stingray.jpg output_stingray.jpg
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/images/imagenet_stingray.jpg" width="650">

``` bash
# C++
$ ./imagenet --network=resnet-18 images/coral.jpg output_coral.jpg

# Python
$ ./imagenet.py --network=resnet-18 images/coral.jpg output_coral.jpg
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/python/docs/images/imagenet_coral.jpg" width="650">

Feel free to experiment with using the different models and see how their accuracies and performance differ - you can download more models with the [Model Downloader](building-repo-2.md#downloading-models) tool.  There are also various test images found under `images/`

### Processing a Video

The [Camera Streaming and Multimedia](aux-streaming.md) page shows the different types of streams that the `imagenet` program can handle.  

Here is an example of running it on a video from disk:

``` bash
# Download test video (thanks to jell.yfish.us)
$ wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/tlswont1jnyu3ix2tbf7utaekpzcx4rc.mkv -O jellyfish.mkv

# C++
$ ./imagenet --network=resnet-18 jellyfish.mkv jellyfish_resnet18.mkv

# Python
$ ./imagenet.py --network=resnet-18 jellyfish.mkv jellyfish_resnet18.mkv
```

Next we'll go through the steps to code your own image recognition program from scratch, first in Python and then C++.
