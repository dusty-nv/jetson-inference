# Classifying Images with ImageNet
There are multiple types of deep learning networks available, including recognition, detection/localization, and soon segmentation.  The first deep learning capability we're highlighting in this tutorial is **image recognition** using an 'imageNet' that's been trained to identify similar objects.

The [`imageNet`](../imageNet.h) object accepts an input image and outputs the probability for each class.  Having been trained on ImageNet database of **[1000 objects](../data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt)**, the standard AlexNet and GoogleNet networks were automatically downloaded during the build step.  As examples of using [`imageNet`](../imageNet.h) we provide a command-line interface called [`imagenet-console`](../imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) and a live camera program called [`imagenet-camera`](../imagenet-camera/imagenet-camera.cpp).

### Using the Console Program on Jetson

First, try using the [`imagenet-console`](../imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) program to test imageNet recognition on some example images.  It loads an image, uses TensorRT and the [`imageNet`](../imageNet.h) class to perform the inference, then overlays the classification and saves the output image.

After [building](#building-repo-2.md), make sure your terminal is located in the aarch64/bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin
```

Then, classify an example image with the [`imagenet-console`](../imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) program.  [`imagenet-console`](../imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) accepts 2 command-line arguments:  the path to the input image and path to the output image (with the class overlay printed).

``` bash
$ ./imagenet-console orange_0.jpg output_0.jpg
```

```

Next, we'll go through the steps to code your own image recognition program from scratch.
