# Setting up Jetson with JetPack

> **note**:  if your Jetson Nano has already been setup with the [SD card image](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write) (which includes the JetPack components), or your Jetson has already been setup with JetPack, you can skip this step and continue to [`Building the Project`](building-repo-2.md)

NVIDIA **[JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)** is a comprehensive SDK for Jetson for both developing and deploying AI and computer vision applications.  JetPack simplifies installation of the OS and drivers and contains the following components:

- L4T Kernel / BSP
- CUDA Toolkit
- cuDNN
- TensorRT
- OpenCV
- VisionWorks
- Multimedia API's

Before attempting to build the repo, make sure that your Jetson has been setup with the latest version of JetPack.

### Jetson Nano

The recommended install method for the Jetson Nano Developer Kit and Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit is to use the **[SD card images](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads)**.  

It comes pre-populated with the JetPack components already installed and can be flashed from a Windows, Mac, or Linux PC.  If you haven't already, follow the [Jetson Nano Getting Started Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) or [Jetson Xavier NX User Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads#?search=Jetson%20Xavier%20NX%20Developer%20Kit%20User%20Guide) to flash the SD card image and setup your device.

### Jetson TX1/TX2 and AGX Xavier

Other Jetson's should be flashed by downloading the [NVIDIA SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/nv-sdk-manager) to a host PC running Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 or Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64.  Connect the Micro-USB or USB-C port to your host PC and enter the device into Recovery Mode.
