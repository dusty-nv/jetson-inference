# Deploying Deep Learning
Welcome to NVIDIA's guide to deploying inference and our embedded deep vision runtime library for **[Jetson TX1](http://www.nvidia.com/object/embedded-systems.html)**.

Included in this repo are resources for efficiently deploying neural networks into the field using NVIDIA **[TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)**.

Vision primitives, such as [`imageNet`](imageNet.h) for image recognition, [`detectNet`](detectNet.h) for object localization, and [`segNet`](segNet.h) for segmentation, inherit from the shared [`tensorNet`](tensorNet.h) object.  Examples are provided for streaming from live camera feed and processing images from disk.  The actions to understand and apply these are represented as ten easy-to-follow steps.

## What's Deep Learning?

New to deep neural networks (DNNs) and machine learning?  Take this [introductory primer](docs/deep-learning.md) on training and inference.

<a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/deep-learning.md"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/7aca8779d265a860d5133cdc8c6c6b76" width="800"></a>

Using NVIDIA deep learning tools, it's easy to **[Get Started](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)** training DNNs and deploying them with high performance.


<a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/deep-learning.md"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/5720072a6941032685ea18c4e4068a23" width="700"></a>

NVIDIA [DIGITS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS) is used to interactively train network models on annotated datasets in the cloud or PC, while TensorRT and Jetson are used to deploy runtime inference in the field.  Together, DIGITS and TensorRT form an effective workflow for developing and deploying deep neural networks capable of implementing advanced AI and perception. 

To get started, see the DIGITS [Getting Started](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md) guide and then the next section of the tutorial, [Getting TensorRT](#getting-tensorrt).

Please install the latest DIGITS on a host PC or cloud service with NVIDIA GPU. See [developer.nvidia.com/digits](http://developer.nvidia.com/digits) for pre-built Docker images and Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

## Getting TensorRT

NVIDIA TensorRT is a new library available in **[JetPack 2.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)** for optimizing and deploying production DNN's.  TensorRT performs a host of graph optimizations and takes advantage of half-precision FP16 support on TX1 to achieve up to 2X or more performance improvement versus Caffe:

<a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/jetpack-doubles-jetson-tx1-deep-learning-inference/"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/91d88749a582e884926686f7a9a7f9fd" width="700"></a>

And in a benchmark conducted measuring images/sec/Watts, with TensorRT Jetson TX1 is up to 20X more power efficient than traditional CPUs at deep-learning inference.  See this **[Parallel ForAll](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/jetpack-doubles-jetson-tx1-deep-learning-inference/)** article for a technical overview of the release.

<a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/jetpack-doubles-jetson-tx1-deep-learning-inference/"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/86d79898dbb3c0664ab1fcf112da4e6e" width="700"></a>

To obtain TensorRT, download the latest [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) to your PC and re-flash your Jetson (see [Jetson TX1 User Guide](http://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/l4t-24-1-jetson-tx1-user-guide)).

## Building from Source
Provided along with this repo are TensorRT-enabled examples of running Googlenet/Alexnet on live camera feed for image recognition, and pedestrian detection networks with localization capabilities (i.e. that provide bounding boxes). 

The latest source can be obtained from [GitHub](http://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) and compiled onboard Jetson TX1.

> **note**:  this [branch](http://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) is verified against 
>        JetPack 2.3 / L4T R24.2 aarch64 (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
      
#### 1. Cloning the repo
To obtain the repository, navigate to a folder of your choosing on the Jetson.  First, make sure git and cmake are installed locally:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install git cmake
```

Then clone the jetson-inference repo:
``` bash
git clone http://github.org/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
```

#### 2. Configuring

When cmake is run, a special pre-installation script (CMakePreBuild.sh) is run and will automatically install any dependencies.

``` bash
cd jetson-inference
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

#### 3. Compiling

Make sure you are still in the jetson-inference/build directory, created above in step #2.

``` bash
cd jetson-inference/build			# omit if pwd is already /build from above
make
```

Depending on architecture, the package will be built to either armhf or aarch64, with the following directory structure:

```
|-build
   \aarch64		    (64-bit)
      \bin			where the sample binaries are built to
      \include		where the headers reside
      \lib			where the libraries are build to
   \armhf           (32-bit)
      \bin			where the sample binaries are built to
      \include		where the headers reside
      \lib			where the libraries are build to
```

binaries residing in aarch64/bin, headers in aarch64/include, and libraries in aarch64/lib.

## Digging Into the Code

For reference, see the available vision primitives, including [`imageNet`](imageNet.h) for image recognition and [`detectNet`](detectNet.h) for object localization.

``` c++
/**
 * Image recognition with GoogleNet/Alexnet or custom models, using TensorRT.
 */
class imageNet : public tensorNet
{
public:
	/**
	 * Network choice enumeration.
	 */
	enum NetworkType
	{
		ALEXNET,
		GOOGLENET
	};

	/**
	 * Load a new network instance
	 */
	static imageNet* Create( NetworkType networkType=GOOGLENET );
	
	/**
	 * Load a new network instance
	 * @param prototxt_path File path to the deployable network prototxt
	 * @param model_path File path to the caffemodel
	 * @param mean_binary File path to the mean value binary proto
	 * @param class_info File path to list of class name labels
	 * @param input Name of the input layer blob.
	 */
	static imageNet* Create( const char* prototxt_path, const char* model_path, const char* mean_binary,
							 const char* class_labels, const char* input="data", const char* output="prob" );

	/**
	 * Determine the maximum likelihood image class.
	 * @param rgba float4 input image in CUDA device memory.
	 * @param width width of the input image in pixels.
	 * @param height height of the input image in pixels.
	 * @param confidence optional pointer to float filled with confidence value.
	 * @returns Index of the maximum class, or -1 on error.
	 */
	int Classify( float* rgba, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, float* confidence=NULL );
};
```

Both inherit from the shared [`tensorNet`](tensorNet.h) object which contains common TensorRT code.

## Classifying Images with ImageNet
There are multiple types of deep learning networks available, including recognition, detection/localization, and soon segmentation.  The first deep learning capability to highlight is **image recognition** using an 'imageNet' that's been trained to identify similar objects.

The [`imageNet`](imageNet.h) object accept an input image and outputs the probability for each class.  Having been trained on ImageNet database of **[1000 objects](data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt)**, the standard AlexNet and GoogleNet networks are downloaded during [step 2](#configuring) from above.

After building, first make sure your terminal is located in the aarch64/bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin
```

Then, classify an example image with the [`imagenet-console`](imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) program.  [`imagenet-console`](imagenet-console/imagenet-console.cpp) accepts 2 command-line arguments:  the path to the input image and path to the output image (with the class overlay printed).

``` bash
$ ./imagenet-console orange_0.jpg output_0.jpg
```

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/8c63ed0975b4c89a4134c320d4e47931"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/8c63ed0975b4c89a4134c320d4e47931" width="700"></a>

``` bash
$ ./imagenet-console granny_smith_1.jpg output_1.jpg
```

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/b6aea9d50490fbe261420ab940de0efd"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/b6aea9d50490fbe261420ab940de0efd" width="700"></a>

Next, we will use [imageNet](imageNet.h) to classify a live video feed from the Jetson onboard camera.

## Running the Live Camera Recognition Demo

Similar to the last example, the realtime image recognition demo is located in /aarch64/bin and is called [`imagenet-camera`](imagenet-camera/imagenet-camera.cpp).
It runs on live camera stream and depending on user arguments, loads googlenet or alexnet with TensorRT. 
``` bash
$ ./imagenet-camera googlenet           # to run using googlenet
$ ./imagenet-camera alexnet             # to run using alexnet
```

The frames per second (FPS), classified object name from the video, and confidence of the classified object are printed to the openGL window title bar.  By default the application can recognize up to 1000 different types of objects, since Googlenet and Alexnet are trained on the ILSVRC12 ImageNet database which contains 1000 classes of objects.  The mapping of names for the 1000 types of objects, you can find included in the repo under [data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt](http://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt)

> **note**:  by default, the Jetson's onboard CSI camera will be used as the video source.  If you wish to use a USB webcam instead, change the `DEFAULT_CAMERA` define at the top of [`imagenet-camera.cpp`](imagenet-camera/imagenet-camera.cpp) to reflect the /dev/video V4L2 device of your USB camera.  The model it's tested with is Logitech C920. 

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/399176be3f3ab2d9bfade84e0afe2abd"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/399176be3f3ab2d9bfade84e0afe2abd" width="800"></a>
<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/93071639e44913b6f23c23db2a077da3"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/93071639e44913b6f23c23db2a077da3" width="800"></a>

## Re-training the Network with Customized Data

The existing GoogleNet and AlexNet models that are downloaded by the repo are pre-trained on [1000 classes of objects](data/networks/ilsvrc12_synset_words.txt).

What if you require a new object class to be added to the network, or otherwise require a different organization of the classes?  

Using [NVIDIA DIGITS](http://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS), networks can be fine-tuned or re-trained from a pre-exisiting network model.
After installing DIGITS on a PC or in the cloud (such as an AWS instance), see the **[Image Folder Specification](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/ImageFolderFormat.md)** to learn how to organize the data for your particular application.

Popular training databases with various annotations and labels include [ImageNet](image-net.org), [MS COCO](mscoco.org), and [Google Images](images.google.com) among others.

See [here](http://www.deepdetect.com/tutorials/train-imagenet/) under the `Downloading the dataset` section to obtain a crawler script that will download the 1000 original classes, including as many of the original images that are still available online.

> **note**: be considerate running the crawler script from a corporate network, they may flag the activity.
> It will probably take overnight on a decent connection to download the 1000 ILSVRC12 classes (100GB) from ImageNet (1.2TB)

Then, while creating the new network model in DIGITS, copy the [GoogleNet prototxt](data/networks/googlenet.prototxt) and specify the existing GoogleNet caffemodel as the DIGITS **Pretrained Model**:

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/610745a8bafae4a5686d45901f5cc6f3"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/610745a8bafae4a5686d45901f5cc6f3" width="800"></a>

The network training should now converge faster than if it were trained from scratch.  After the desired accuracy has been reached, copy the new model checkpoint back over to your Jetson and proceed as before, but now with the added classes available for recognition.

## Locating Object Coordinates using DetectNet
The previous image recognition examples output class probabilities representing the entire input image.   The second deep learning capability to highlight is detecting multiple objects, and finding where in the video those objects are located (i.e. extracting their bounding boxes).  This is performed using a 'detectNet' - or object detection / localization network.

The [`detectNet`](detectNet.h) object accepts as input the 2D image, and outputs a list of coordinates of the detected bounding boxes.  Three example detection network models are are automatically downloaded during the repo [source configuration](#configuring):

1. **ped-100**  (single-class pedestrian detector)
2. **multiped-500**   (multi-class pedestrian + baggage detector)
3. **facenet-120**  (single-class facial recognition detector)

To process test images with [`detectNet`](detectNet.h) and TensorRT, use the [`detectnet-console`](detectnet-console/detectnet-console.cpp) program.  [`detectnet-console`](detectnet-console/detectnet-console.cpp) accepts command-line arguments representing the path to the input image and path to the output image (with the bounding box overlays rendered).  Some test images are included with the repo:

``` bash
$ ./detectnet-console peds-007.png output-7.png
```

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/eb1066d317406abb66be939e23150ccc"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/eb1066d317406abb66be939e23150ccc" width="900"></a>

To change the network that [`detectnet-console`](detectnet-console/detectnet-console.cpp) uses, modify [`detectnet-console.cpp`](detectnet-console/detectnet-console.cpp) (beginning line 33):
``` c
detectNet* net = detectNet::Create( detectNet::PEDNET_MULTI );	 // uncomment to enable one of these 
//detectNet* net = detectNet::Create( detectNet::PEDNET );
//detectNet* net = detectNet::Create( detectNet::FACENET );
```
Then to recompile, navigate to the `jetson-inference/build` directory and run `make`.
### Multi-class Object Detection
When using the multiped-500 model (`PEDNET_MULTI`), for images containing luggage or baggage in addition to pedestrians, the 2nd object class is rendered with a green overlay.
``` bash
$ ./detectnet-console peds-008.png output-8.png
```

<a href="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/c0c41b17fb6ea05315b64f3ee7cbbb84"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/c0c41b17fb6ea05315b64f3ee7cbbb84" width="900"></a>

## Running the Live Camera Detection Demo

Similar to the previous example, [`detectnet-camera`](detectnet-camera/detectnet-camera.cpp) runs the object detection networks on live video feed from the Jetson onboard camera.  Launch it from command line along with the type of desired network:

``` bash
$ ./detectnet-camera multiped       # run using multi-class pedestrian/luggage detector
$ ./detectnet-camera ped-100        # run using original single-class pedestrian detector
$ ./detectnet-camera facenet        # run using facial recognition network
$ ./detectnet-camera                # by default, program will run using multiped
```

> **note**:  to achieve maximum performance while running detectnet, increase the Jetson TX1 clock limits by running the script:
>  `sudo ~/jetson_clocks.sh`
<br/>
> **note**:  by default, the Jetson's onboard CSI camera will be used as the video source.  If you wish to use a USB webcam instead, change the `DEFAULT_CAMERA` define at the top of [`detectnet-camera.cpp`](detectnet-camera/detectnet-camera.cpp) to reflect the /dev/video V4L2 device of your USB camera.  The model it's tested with is Logitech C920.  

## Re-training DetectNet with DIGITS

For a step-by-step guide to training custom DetectNets, see the **[Object Detection](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/tree/digits-4.0/examples/object-detection)** example included in DIGITS version 4:

<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/tree/digits-4.0/examples/object-detection"><img src="https://a70ad2d16996820e6285-3c315462976343d903d5b3a03b69072d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/0c1a5ee3ab9c4629ac61cbbe9aae3e10" width="500"></a>

The DIGITS guide above uses the [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) dataset, however [MS COCO](http://mscoco.org) also has bounding data available for a variety of objects.
